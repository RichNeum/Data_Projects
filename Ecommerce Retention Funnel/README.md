## 🎯 Project Goals

- Transform raw transaction logs into structured, meaningful business metrics.
- Develop a conversion funnel from user activity logs to identify key drop-off points.
- Conduct cohort analysis and calculate monthly retention rates.
- Present findings in a clean, client-ready format for stakeholder decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Key Assumptions

- The `raw_user_activity` dataset accurately reflects all user activity during the selected period.
- Data inconsistencies and missing values are minimal and do not materially affect the overall analysis.
- Column names and data formats are clean and consistent across the dataset.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Filtered and cleaned raw logs to remove irrelevant or malformed entries.
- Ensured data consistency across event types, product categories, and date fields.
- Structured data into new tabs for processed tables, pivot analysis, and client readability.
- Created calculated columns to support funnel stages and cohort group identification.

## 🔍 Key Analyses

### 1. Conversion Funnel Analysis

**Highlights:**
- Built a three-stage conversion funnel from product view → add to cart → purchase.
- Calculated the conversion rates between each stage.

**Findings:**
- View-to-cart conversion: **29%**  
- Cart-to-purchase conversion: **34%**  
- Overall view-to-purchase conversion: **10%**

---

### 2. Cohort & Retention Analysis

**Highlights:**
- Grouped users into cohorts based on their first month of activity.
- Calculated monthly retention percentages for each cohort.

**Findings:**
- For the **September 2020 cohort**:  
  - Retention after 1 month: **13%**  
  - Retention by month 4: **3%**
- Steep drop-offs across all cohorts after the first month.

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Conversion drop-off** is most significant after adding to cart, indicating friction during the checkout process.
- **Customer retention** is low, with dramatic declines after the first month, suggesting weak engagement or insufficient post-purchase strategies.
- A **small percentage of users** proceed to make purchases, indicating the need to improve the product presentation or checkout experience.

---

## 💡 Strategic Opportunities

- **Address checkout abandonment:** Evaluate the product detail and checkout flows to minimize friction or distractions.
- **Boost retention with personalization:** Launch loyalty or re-engagement programs to increase returning customer rates.
- **Enhance onboarding for new users:** Provide clear calls to action and incentives during the first interaction to build long-term loyalty.
- **Implement feedback collection loops:** Gain insights from users who abandon or churn to inform strategy.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Checkout Optimization:** A/B test different product and checkout page layouts to improve cart-to-purchase conversion.
- **Retention Campaigns:** Introduce loyalty rewards, automated email flows, and personalized product suggestions for new users.
- **User Feedback:** Survey recent churned users to identify patterns in dissatisfaction or confusion.
- **Continued Monitoring:** Use monthly cohort analysis to track the effects of interventions on long-term retention.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
