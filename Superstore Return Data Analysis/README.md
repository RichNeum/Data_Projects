## 🎯 Project Goals

- Identify key drivers behind customer returns.
- Analyze trends by product category, region, customer segment, and time.
- Uncover patterns in customer behavior related to returned purchases.
- Deliver actionable insights through interactive Tableau dashboards to reduce return rates and improve customer experience.

---

## 🔍 Key Assumptions

- Returns are treated as a negative revenue impact, requiring strategic business attention.
- Product category and sub-category play a major role in return likelihood.
- Geographic and seasonal patterns influence return behavior.
- High-volume return customers exhibit unique behavioral traits that can be used for early identification and intervention.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Joined and filtered relevant tables: Orders, Returns, and Customers.
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
- Standardized product categories and geographic names for consistency.
- Created calculated fields to analyze:
  - Return Rate by Category/Sub-Category
  - State-wise Return Percentages
  - Monthly Return Trends
  - Return Frequency per Customer
  - Product Profitability with Return Overlay

## 📊 Dashboards

### 1. Product Sub-Category Returns Dashboard

**Highlights:**
- Return rates by product sub-category
- Sales vs. return ratios
- Profitability impact of high-return items

**Use case:** Identify high-risk products and explore potential discontinuation or vendor renegotiation.

---

### 2. Geographic Return Trends Dashboard

**Highlights:**
- State-wise and regional return rates
- Comparison of returns vs. total sales by geography
- Profit and loss by returned products per state

**Use case:** Target regions with high return volumes for customer education or fulfillment optimization.

---

### 3. Time-Based Return Trends Dashboard

**Highlights:**
- Monthly and seasonal return trends
- Correlation between sales peaks and return spikes
- Year-over-year comparison of return volume

---

### 4. Customer Behavior Dashboard

**Highlights:**
- Customers with the highest return frequency
- Return-to-purchase ratios
- Analysis of return-prone customer segments

**Use case:** Develop customer-specific return policies or loyalty incentives to curb excessive returns.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Technology and Office Supplies** sub-categories show the highest return rates, especially in high-value items like phones and copiers.
- **Western and Southern states** have disproportionately high return rates relative to sales volume, affecting profitability in those regions.
- Returns **peak in Q4**, likely due to increased holiday sales and post-purchase dissatisfaction or buyer’s remorse.
- A **small cohort of customers** is responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of returns, with some returning over 50% of their purchases.
- **Low-profit-margin items** with high return rates are especially damaging to net revenue, often resulting in negative profit.

---

## 💡 Strategic Opportunities

- Implement stricter return policies for **high-risk product categories** like technology.
- Roll out **customer education initiatives** focused on product specifications and usage, especially in high-return regions.
- **Track and flag return-heavy customers** for review or personalized support.
- Introduce **holiday return caps** or incentives for no-return purchases to offset seasonal spikes.
- Evaluate vendor agreements for **high-return items** and consider renegotiation or product replacement.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Category-Level Controls:** Limit return windows and enforce restocking fees for electronics and office equipment with high return likelihood.
- **Regional Campaigns:** Offer clearer sizing, compatibility, and usage guides in regions with high return rates to reduce post-purchase confusion.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Create behavioral flags for customers with frequent returns to tailor communication or loyalty programs.
- **Holiday Policy Adjustments:** Implement return blackout periods or loyalty discounts for non-returned items during high-risk return seasons.
- **Vendor Review Protocols:** Collaborate with suppliers to analyze return-related issues and optimize product quality or shipping accuracy.
