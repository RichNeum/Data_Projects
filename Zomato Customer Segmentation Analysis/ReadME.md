## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze customer data to identify meaningful behavioral and demographic patterns.
- Segment users using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
- Uncover key metrics related to user activity, engagement, and loyalty.
- Deliver strategic business recommendations to improve retention and increase revenue.

## 🔍 Key Assumptions

- Each row represents an individual user.
- Purchase behavior is indicative of long-term customer value.

- Removed null or missing values in key fields.
- Standardized date and currency formats.
- Transformed categorical values for consistency (e.g., gender, location).
- Engineered RFM features:
  - **Recency**: Days since last purchase.
  - **Frequency**: Total number of orders.
  - **Monetary**: Total spending.

### 3. RFM Analysis Dashboard

Visualizes segmentation based on:
- **Recency** (R)
- **Frequency** (F)
- **Monetary** (M)

Segments users into personas:
- Champions

- **Dormant Users**: High-value customers with declining engagement in recent months.
- **High LTV**: Concentrated among users aged 25–34 with frequent and recent purchases.
